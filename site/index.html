was made to preserve the precious memories of my Barmitzvah, one of the most important and
happy days of my life.&nbsp; I don't want to remember my barmy by opening an old drawer
and pulling out some photos, I want these reminders kept in a safe place where everyone
can see them.&nbsp; Obviously, mainly family will visit this page, but at least by having
things on the internet they are available to everyone and they will (hopefully) last
longer.</font></p>
