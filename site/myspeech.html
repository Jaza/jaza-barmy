<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Friends, family, rabbis, spirits &amp; honoured
guests, I hope you are enjoying yourselves so far.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Before I get into the grit of the speech, I must
give a few, and I will try to seriously make it a few, essential and special thankyous.
First and foremost, I must thank my great-grandmother for surviving to this day, and Nana
Felka I want you to know that we are all honoured to have you here with us. I hope you are
as happy as we are that you&#146;re here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I must give a special thankyou to Rabbi Zalman (hope
that isn&#146;t too formal), for teaching me all year and for being here tonight. Zalman
has put as much work into this occasion as I have, if not more, and without him I
don&#146;t know how I would have managed to learn everything I needed to know.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">My own mum gets a special thankyou for arranging the
whole thing. If not for her, I doubt that we would be here and everything would be
organised. Mummy has many different qualifications, including real estate stickybeak,
holiday organiser, barmitzvah veteran, schlepper, and of course, being a mummy. In this
major operation my mum has proven her true natural ability of organisation, and she
deserves a big round of applause.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">After the boss there comes my dad, who is also
qualified in different areas. Apart from being a shul schlepper every Friday night &amp;
Saturday, Daddy is a go-to-bed and have-a-shower pro, an efficient worrier, a TV schloofer
and a computer illiterate. Oh yeah, and a barrister, but that&#146;s only something minor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I have one apology from a person that would like to
be here, but couldn&#146;t quite make it. My dog Boo would have loved to have been here,
but the caterers don&#146;t specialize in chicken wings and brisket bones, and we also
didn&#146;t like the idea of throwing a tennis ball across the room right through dinner.
We also couldn&#146;t afford to get carpet cleaners to clean away the inevitable muddy
pawprints, but I assure you that Boo would be here if not for these technical problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Unfortunately my Nona &amp; Nono aren&#146;t here to
see me either. I&#146;m sure they would have been proud of me, and Nona is definitely here
in spirit. Nono could not come from the Montefiore home, as he isn&#146;t well enough, but
when I saw him this morning he wished me mazal tov.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Thankyou tonnes Nana &amp; Poppy for making it to
this day. Poppy, over the years you have bought me watches, taken me to the movies, you
have taught me the American chopsticks and given me advice, and it was indeed a great
honour to have a <i>kohen</i> for a grandad yesterday! Nana, thanks for all the years I
slept over, for all your orange cakes and for the countless swims we&#146;ve had for all
the Sunday afternoons in all the summers I can remember!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">You may be surprised, but I do actually have
something to say apart from thanking everyone for being here. Dad has already done most of
them, and besides this is meant to be a speech, not a lullaby to put you to sleep. I would
like to tell you all what this day really means to me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Today, or yesterday, was the day that I finished
being a Jewish boy and started my life as a Jewish man. The first of many things this
means is that my parents are no longer responsible for what I do, and it is no longer up
to them to teach me about Judaism and encourage me to be a good observant Jew. Of course,
they have made it pretty easy for me, as they have encouraged me and taught me more than
enough for me to keep going on my own. But it is now up to me to use my own initiative to
participate in Jewish activities, to keep going to shule and to keep mitzvot. If I
don&#146;t do these things, you can&#146;t blame my parents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Another thing this means is that I can now be
counted as part on a <i>minyan</i>. This is great, because it means that when we go to
shule and there are 9 men there, I don&#146;t have to hold a chumash anymore!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">In my parsha, parshas Bo, g-d quotes: &quot;For
seven days you shall eat matzos&quot; (Shemos 12:15). This is where g-d commands us to eat
matzos, and as it is a comandment and a mitzvah, we should do everything in our power to
fulfil it. To show you just how important it is to eat matzos, I would like to tell you a
story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">A young Boch had been training in Yeshiva when WWII
began. The boy, whose name was Chaim, had been captured by the Germans, but by a miracle
had escaped. He had come to Lublin, in Poland, which was controlled by the Russians at
that time. He met his family there, but when they were reunited they were given a choice
of becoming Russian citizens or living in Siberia. They chose Siberia, as they would one
day have more chance of escaping from there.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Chaim, his father and brother were in the same
barracks in Siberia, and were forced to live in bad conditions and do hard work. Although
they were not allowed to keep any mitzvahs, Chaim did manage to put on tefillin every day.
When he was caught once and the guard tried to take away his tefillin, Chaim said
he&#146;d rather be shot than give them away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Unfortunately, when <i>Pesach</i> came Chaim did not
know what to do. The only food they received was stale bread, and they didn&#146;t know
how they could stay alive without eating <i>chametz</i>. They had been sent some matzah
and wine from the American rescue committee, but not enough to last them all through <i>Pesach</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Chaim had one idea. The one thing they still owned
was his father&#146;s fur coat, and if they could sell it for some non-chametz food, they
would be able to survive <i>Pesach</i>. So one day, when a wagon came through the camp
laden with fruit and vegetables, Chaim traded a few bags of the parcels for his
father&#146;s coat.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">When <i>Pesach </i>began a few days later, all the
Jews in the camp were gathered in one tent for a <i>seder</i>. They were eating and
singing happily, when a guard stormed into the room. He was appalled that they dare do
this, and immediately accused Chaim of starting the <i>seder</i>, and put him in a prison
cell in isolation. Chaim prayed to g-d that he would be rewarded for his good deed some
day, and hoped that he had not gone to all the trouble to keep the <i>seder</i> for
nothing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">In reward for his good deed that night, Chaim was
freed from the barracks. He eventually settled in America, where his children are well
known for their good services to this day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">This story teaches me that when we do a mitzvah, we
will be well rewarded for it some day, and we should be willing to sacrifice as many
luxuries as we must to keep g-d&#145;s mitzvahs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Finally, I would like to evaluate my bar mitzvah and
see what I have learnt from it, and what I can continue to do now that it&#146;s finished
(well, almost finished). In this year I have learnt many prayers, I have learnt to follow
a service, and I have learnt the meaning of some prayers. Some of the sections of my
Parsha have been hammered into me so well that I could say them 20 years from now! I have
learnt how to use my Da-at, which is the power not only to know and understand concepts,
but to learn from them and to realize their significance. Once again I must thank Zalman
for bringing out the Da-at within me, and within some friends that I have been learning
with.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I have decided that I will keep the mitzvah of
putting on <i>tefillin</i>, and will put them on at least once a week. I will give some
money to <i>tzedakah</i> every day, and will continue to go to shule on Shabbat.</font></p>
