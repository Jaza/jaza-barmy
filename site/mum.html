SPEECH</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Rabbis, family and friends,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">My job tonight is a simple one. It is basically to
relax, look good for the photos and enjoy the evening. I am not a religious person, but I
am a doer. As Fruma once said in a shiur I went to, that women are naturally on a higher
spiritual level than men because the physical work they do elevates them spiritually to a
higher level than men. Maybe that is why the men have to pray so often, they are trying to
catch up to our level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I am not going to embarrass Jeremy by singing
(except one song later tonight for Shula which he has agreed is Ok to do) and I am not
going to make a speech because Dennis is the barrister in the family, but I do have the
very pleasant task of reading out the good wishes from a few special people and a poem
from our very dear friend Dr Martin Adler, who is caring for his sick father and could not
be with us tonight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Before I read the poem I would like to thank Dennis
for taking Jeremy to Shule every Friday night and Shabbat for many years, and also for all
the shlepping to cheder for years while I had Sunday mornings off. I would also like to
thank the Goldbergs &amp; the Brucks who have shared the too-ing and fro-ing from St Ives
both from East Ryde and now from East Lindfield, and also the Goldsteins and Geyers who
have shared the driving with us this year. I would also like to thank the Barmitzvah
breakfast dads who who have shown the boys the cullinary delights of french toast, and the
delights of nesquik on just about anything. I would like to thank Renee &amp; Les Mill and
family for having had Jeremy numerous times for Shabbat lunch over the last year or two,
it has always been an uplifting experience for him. Lastly I would like to thank Zalman
for his dedication to the Jewish education of all of our children who are in the public
school system. I know of no better Cheder in Sydney than Chabad Hebrew School, and I can
say this as a Hebrew teacher myself, that it is one of the most thankless jobs and one of
the hardest to do. If all of our children achieve even ½ of what Jeremy has achieved,
then our Jewish continuity into the year 2000 and beyond is assured. I am not going to say
anything to Jeremy because he&#146;s heard it all before but Martin&#146;s expresses so
beautifully the essence of what I think about my son. Thank you &quot;Uncle Marty&quot;
for your words today.</font></p>
