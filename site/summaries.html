        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem tells Moses to go to Pharoah, for he has
        hardened his heart, so that he may taunt Egypt. Moses and Aaron go to Pharoah and warn him
        that if he doesn&#146;t let the Children of Israel go, locusts will come and cover the
        surface of the Earth, so many that one could not see the ground. They would destroy all
        that was left of the previous plague, the hail.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Pharoah&#146;s servants pleaded with him to end the
        plagues and let the Children of Israel go. So Pharoah brought Moses and Aaron back and
        asked them who will be leaving Egypt. Moses replied, &quot;We will go with our young and
        our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and our cattle, for it is a
        festival of Hashem&quot;. He said &quot;A festival&quot; because all Jews must participate
        in festivals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Pharoah refused, and allowed only the men to leave
        Egypt. He felt that by doing this he would drive the evil out and prevent the locusts from
        coming.</font>lfil Hashem&#146;s tasks, it&#146;s not good enough.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem brought the 8<sup>th</sup> plague, the
        locust-swarm, into the land of Egypt on a steady east wind all day and night. The locusts
        covered the entire surface of the land and ate up all the greenery that the hail had left
        over.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Pharoah wished for the locusts to be gone before
        they ate the roots of the vegetation, which would cause more permanent damage. He summoned
        Moses and Aaron, confessed he had sinned, and begged them to make Hashem pardon his sin
        and remove the locusts. So Hashem drove the locusts into the sea with a west wind, so that
        not a single locust remained in Egypt. But Pharoah&#146;s heart remained hardened.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Commanded by Hashem, Moses stretched his hand
        towards the heavens, and for three days the Egyptians could not see even if they lit
        candles, and the darkness was so thick and tangible that for three days they could not
        move. But the Children of Israel had light and could move.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">While the Egyptians were in darkness, the Children
        of Israel could move, talk to each other and help each other. They were (as always) a
        community of people that were close together and worked with each other. The Egyptians
        were put into thick darkness because they were isolated from each other, and when an
        Egyptian was in distress his friend could not help him, even though he knew that his
        friend needed him. I have learnt from this that for a community to be separated is among
        the most severe punishments of all, and we should try very hard to avoid it from befalling
        us.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Pharoah allowed the Children of Israel to leave
        Egypt, but he did not allow their livestock to go with them. Moses rejected the offer,
        saying that eventually Pharoah would be so sorry for his sins that he would sacrifice his
        own livestock to Hashem. He said that they must take their livestock with them, as it was
        their property and their wealth.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem still hardened Pharoah&#146;s heart, and
        Pharoah warned Moses that should they meet again, he would surely die. Moses replied,
        saying that he would never see his face again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem warned Moses of the coming of the tenth
        plague, and said that after this Pharoah will drive out the Children of Israel. He asked
        that all the Jews request gold &amp; silver from their Egyptian neighbours. The Egyptians
        were willing to give gold &amp; silver. Moses became a great &amp; respected figure among
        Jews &amp; Egyptians alike.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Moses warned Pharoah that at about midnight that
        night, all the firstborn in Egypt would die, from the firstborn of Pharoah to the
        firstborn of the Egyptian beasts. But as for the Children of Israel, no man or beast would
        be harmed. Pharoah did not heed Moses&#146; warning, which was the word of Hashem, and did
        not let the Children of Israel go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem told Moses &amp; Aaron that this month
        (Nissan) would be the first month of the year. This was the commandment of keeping <i>Rosh
        Chodesh</i>, and it was the first commandment that the Children of Israel received as a
        people. It is an especially important commandment, as observing the new moon and the new
        month is vital knowledge that we must have, for if we don&#146;t know what month it is we
        don&#146;t know when to celebrate our festivals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem told Moses &amp; Aaron to tell all the Jews
        to keep the commandment of the <i>Pesach-offering</i>. On the tenth of the month, there
        should be an unblemished lamb or kid for every father&#146;s house. The blood of the
        animal must be smeared on the doorposts and the lintel of the house in which it was to be
        eaten. They must eat the flesh that night, with bitter herbs and matzos. They must eat all
        of it before morning, that which is left must be burnt in the fire. They should eat it in
        haste, with their loins girded, ready to go.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Hashem himself (not an angel) would kill all the
        firstborn of Egypt that night, but the blood on the doorposts of the Israelites would be a
        sign for him to pass over our houses. He commanded the Children of Israel to keep the
        festival of <i>Pesach</i> in every generation, and to eat matzos for seven days during the
        festival.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">From this I can learn that the mitzvah of keeping <i>Rosh
    Chodesh</i> is very important, because if we did not know when to celebrate our festivals,
    we would not be able to celebrate them at all, and without our festivities we would not be
    the kind of people that we are now.</font></td>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Moses relayed Hashem&#146;s instructions regarding
        the <i>Pesach-offering</i>, to all the Children of Israel. That is, he instructed them to
        smudge their lintels and doorposts with blood, and to stay inside their houses until
        morning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Further, he told them that if one day your son asks
        why the <i>Pesach-offering</i> is done, and what its meaning is, they would tell him that
        it is an offering to Hashem, who saved us when he killed the Egyptian firstborn. And the
        people bowed in gratitude, for they knew that they would soon be a free nation. They went
        and did as they were commanded.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">When your wicked son challenges the meaning of an
    offering to Hashem, he is trying to rebel, and not participate. We know that he is wicked
    because of the way he talks, asking why we even bother to celebrate the festival. We can
    prevent him from creating conflict by giving him a true and beneficial answer. This shows
    me that the wicked, who are always challenging the truth, can be purified (if not rebuked)
    with a true, g-dly answer. Even the evil can never succeed in finding fault in the words
    of Hashem.</font></td>

        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">At midnight that night, Hashem killed every
        firstborn in the land (Excepting Israelites), From the firstborn of Pharoah to the
        firstborn of his beasts. There was a great outcry in Egypt; not one house was without a
        corpse. Only Pharoah himself was spared, so that he could live to praise Hashem and to
        tell the world of his greatness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Pharoah came to Moses, and pleaded that he leave. He
        made no conditions on who left, he allowed the Children of Israel to go with whatever they
        pleased, so long as he could be rid of them. All of Egypt begged for the Jews to leave in
        haste, so they could be gone and the suffering would end.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">The Jews left with their bread before it leavened,
        and as Moses told them to, they demanded gold and silver from the Egyptians, which they
        mercifully gave away. They travelled from Egypt, an estimated 3 million people. They baked
        their unleavened bread and ate it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">The Jews had been in exile 430 years, and the very
        day that this period ended was the day of Exodus. Hashem had been waiting for the day 430
        years earlier.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">A wicked and powerful man, Pharoah had his pride and
    arrogance torn to pieces by Moses and the plagues. Pharoah once had authority over Moses,
    but because of Pharoah&#146;s evil and Moses&#146; faith in Hashem, Pharoah crawled to
    Moses and begged for the suffering to end. From this I can learn that when one has faith
    in Hashem, he can defeat all his enemies as Moses did.</font></td>

        beast is his, and must be redeemed when born.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Moses spoke to the Children of Israel, and told them

        days every year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">Moses then told the Children of Israel that every
        firstborn male livestock is Hashem&#146;s as well. And if ones son should ever ask why the
        firstborn males are redeemed, you should tell him that Hashem struck down the firstborn of
        Egypt, the first issue of man &amp; beast. In return for this, Hashem receives our
        firstborn, and we redeem all our firstborn sons.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">From this I can learn that we must always remember
    to wear tefillin, as they contain the <i>Shema</i>. This is a prayer that not only reminds
    us of our connection with Hashem, and the most basic principles of our religion, but also
    keeps in our mind that Hashem removed us from Egypt.</font></td>

    Haftara, Hashem warns the Prophet Yirmiyahu that the great forces of the Babylonian Empire
    will come and strike Egypt.</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">He proclaims that
    the Egyptian Empire will be swept into exile by the invaders from the north. He warns that
    Egypt should make vessels, and prepare to leave their home, or else they shall be totally
    wiped out. The Babylonian army would be vaster than the locusts, which are without number.
    He says that they shall be exiled for their appalling treatment of the Jews throughout the
    years.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">At this time the Jews were losing faith in Hashem
    and were interested only in them selves. Some even went so far as to reform to idolatry.
    The prophet warned that as the Egyptians would be invaded for their sins, so too would the
    Jews unless they returned to their faith, had compassion for each other and begged Hashem
    for forgiveness. He prophesizes the destruction of the temple and another exile, should
    the Jews continue the way they were headed. Unfortunately, the people did not heed his
    words and later suffered for it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#00FFFF">At the end of the Haftara, Yirmiyahu gave a
    comforting message, saying that as long as we, his people, serve him as we should, we
    shall survive through history and outlive or destroy all our enemies. Hashem is always
    with us, protecting us, watching over us from afar, and we have no reason to fear anything
    as long as Hashem is watching over us. If we all have enough faith, we can feel secure
    that no harm will come to us as servants of the lord.</font></td>
