SPEECH</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Thank you Neville,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Rabbis, family and friends.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Firstly I would like to give a very big thank you to
Neville and Ros for being here and for Neville agreeing to be MC. I know it was not easy
because of your work commitments in Queensland and both Sandra and I appreciate your
coming very much. We got to know you both very well over the years at Lane Cove and I know
Jeremy has always been very special for you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Secondly I must thank the person without whose
efforts tonight wouldn&#146;t have been possible and that&#146;s Sandra. Over the years
you have had many roles to fill, that of wife, mother, secretary, teacher, office manager,
entertainer and now that of Barmitzvah consultant. Your planning and organisation of
tonight has been nothing short of military like in precision &#150; from the early stages
of finding a venue, caterer and band to the last minute things like finding the correct
kosher lollies for Shule. Thanks for making it all possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Once again I welcome the interstate guests Ros and
Neville and my cousins Max and Sarah from Melbourne. It is very unfortunate and
Sandra&#146;s brother and sister in law, Mark and Susie (who are in Switzerland) could not
be here with us and also Sandra&#146;s cousins, Wendy and Anthony Marks (in Melbourne) and
I know they all very much wanted to be here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">On a sadder note I know tonight and yesterday is an
event my late mother, Jeremy&#146;s Nona Shula, would have loved to attend and would have
been beaming with pride to see him sing in Shule &#150; we know she is here with us in
spirit. Also it is sad that my dad, Jeremy&#146;s Nono Issy, is not well enough to be here
and he too would have had much naches from seeing Jeremy. We saw him today at the
Montefiore Home and in his own way he wished Jeremy all the best.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Jeremy is fortunate to have his great grandmother
here &#150; Nana Felka, who has been living for this day &#150; and you may have heard her
interruption to the Rabbi&#146;s speech in Shule yesterday when the Rabbi said Jeremy is a
good kid &#150; she interrupted &#150; no, he is the best!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I must also mention Nana late husband Max Gray, who
was like a grandfather to Sandra, Mark and Linda for 33 years and loved Jeremy like a
great grandfather for 6 years. Although he was allergic to Rabbis but not Rebbetzins, he
had terrific zest for life and loved a good L&#146;chaim, so we know he is opening his
best bottle of red tonight and is drinking it with us.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">But Jeremy is also fortunate to have his other
grandparents, Poppy Michael and Nana Shirley here and they are extremely proud of his
efforts yesterday. Jeremy had the added honour of having a grandfather who is a
&quot;kohen&quot; and was called up first. Nana Shirley, whose father was a milliner,
didn&#146;t let us down in the hat department and even managed to get Sandra looking
elegant in her reconditioned hat. And thanks to Nana Shirley, the kosher lollies rained
down on Jeremy&#146;s head. And now that you both know the way to Chabad from Double Bay
(as you had 2 practice runs over the last few weeks) we might see you there more often.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I know that Shirley&#146;s late parents, Nana Betty
and Grandpa Harry Shagrin would also have been very proud of Jeremy. I still remember on
the day Jeremy was born when Grandpa Harry rang me to say how excited he was to have a
great grandson. I&#146;m sure that as one of the founders of South Head Synagogue and a
true mensch, he would have been very impressed with Jeremy&#146;s love of yiddishkeit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Well, Jeremy the big day has come and gone. I know
you are not as nervous today as you were yesterday. You did a fantastic job yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">I know it is customary on such occasions to give
father/son advice but I will try to be brief. Both Sandra and I are very proud not only of
how you did yesterday but of your very positive and enthusiastic attitude to your
Jewishness. This is something we both consider of utmost importance and have always tried
to pass on to you whether it is going to Shule on Friday night or Shabbos, going to
Cheder, Gan Issy camps, Jewish music and humour. You have always participated become you
have loved it. You have now reached a crucial stage where your involvement becomes your
responsibility but continue to be involved because you loved it, because it is something
positive, and because you want to do it. You have had wonderful teachers like Zalman who
I&#146;m sure will continue to be there and to guide you in the future. As Zalman said a
few weeks ago, the one thing we are unsure of is the future and it is like being in a
spaceship travelling to the unknown. You can still have time for the internet and games
but don&#146;t forget to read your guide book every day, as otherwise you may get lost on
this voyage of life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF">Finally, I would like to thank everyone for coming
both yesterday and tonight and sharing this simcha with us</font>.</p>
